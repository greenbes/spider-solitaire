# Spider Solitaire Rules

## Objective

Build 8 complete sequences of the same suit from King down to Ace. Each completed sequence is removed to the foundation. Win by completing all 8 suits.

## Setup

- **Decks:** 2 standard decks (104 cards total)
- **Tableau:** 10 columns — first 4 columns have 6 cards, remaining 6 columns have 5 cards
- **Face-up:** Only the top card of each column is face-up initially
- **Stock:** 50 remaining cards for dealing

## Gameplay

### Moving Cards

- Place a card on any card exactly one rank higher (e.g., 5 on 6)
- Any card can be placed on an empty column
- Moving sequences: Only same-suit descending sequences can be moved as a group

### Revealing Cards

When all face-up cards are removed from a column, the next card flips face-up.

### Dealing from Stock

- Deal 10 cards (one to each column) when stuck
- All columns must have at least one card before dealing
- 5 deals available from the stock

## Completing Suits

A complete sequence (K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A) of the same suit automatically moves to the foundation.

## Difficulty Variations

| Difficulty | Suits Used       | Description       |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 Suit     | Spades only      | Easiest           |
| 2 Suits    | Spades & Hearts  | Medium            |
| 4 Suits    | All suits        | Hardest (classic) |

## Win Rate

With good play, approximately 1 in 3 games is winnable.
