# Spider Solitaire — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement Spider Solitaire.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — Milestone-by-milestone instructions:
  - `01-foundation.md` — Design tokens, data model, application shell
  - `02-game-board.md` — Main game board with all game logic

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens
- `data-model/` — Core entities and TypeScript types
- `shell/` — Application shell components (toolbar, modals)
- `sections/game-board/` — Game board components, types, sample data, test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — includes design tokens, data model, and application shell
3. Continue with Game Board (`instructions/incremental/02-game-board.md`)
4. Use `prompts/section-prompt.md` as a template for each section
5. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

The game board section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/game-board/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.).

## Architecture Note

This is a **local-only game application**:
- All game logic runs in the browser
- User preferences stored in localStorage
- No authentication or user accounts
- No remote data persistence
- No server or network required after installation
- Can be deployed as a static site or PWA

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about tech stack and game logic.
- **Test the game rules** — Spider Solitaire has specific rules for card movement, suit completion, and dealing.
- **Focus on game logic** — The UI components are complete; implement the game engine that powers them.
- **Implement undo early** — It's easier to build the undo system alongside the move system.
